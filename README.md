# ticTacToeHomework
Covering homework in the bridging program

This implementation of Tic Tac Toe includes:

* Player naming
* Quitting early
* Resizable grids
* Loops that ask for user input until they get valid values
* Games that can be restarted after a win/loss/draw
* Win states that don't use hardcoded values
* A grid that isn't hardcoded, either

The Fancy branch also includes:

* More functions
* Fewer comments -- figure it out for yourself
* Regular expressions for checking user input
* Regular expressions that check for filled game boards
* .flatmap(), .joined() -- and flatmap chained with joined!
* Variable emojis instead of X's & O's

What we don't have yet:

* Logic for grids of arbitrary size...what if we want a 13 x 5 Tic Tac Toe game??
* Counting wins and losses
* Functions for handling all our dang strings
* Two-player mode
* Formal error handling
