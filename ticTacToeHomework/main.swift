     using the String method .lowercased() above makes it easier to match the 
     user's answer with our string, "quit".
     
     when we take in user input, we should make it all the same case --
     otherwise we'll have to check if the user typed quit, Quit, QUIT, etc. 
     
     If we used something called regular expressions, we wouldn't have to use .lowercased(),
     but regular expressions are a much more complicated topic than String methods!
