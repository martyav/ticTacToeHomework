             We made checkColumns one long array of strings so we could use stride on it.
             Stride lets us go through the array by skipping over some elements 
             and by starting in different places on each trip through the loop.
             
             On our first trip, we start on index 0, and stride by 3's, so we go down 1, 4, 7.
             Then we go to index 1, and stride down by 3's -- 2, 5, 8.
             Then we hit our last index, 2, and stride down by 3's -- 3, 6, 9.
             
             There is a method called .flatMap() that we could have used to make 
             our three-array grid into one long array. We didn't use it here because
             .flatMap()'s use can get kind of confusing...especially since you 
             haven't covered closures yet.
